    "section": "",
    "text": "Iowa was not good on offense in 2023, and everyone knows it. How did they manage to win 10 games and make it to the Big Ten Championship, though?\nIowa’s scoring offense ranked 132 out of 133 FBS teams in 2023, averaging a miserable 15.4 points/game. Who was worse then that? 1-11 Kent State at 14.7.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#| message: false\niowascoringoff &lt;- read_csv(\"iowascoringoff.csv\")\niowaqbs &lt;- read_csv(\"iowaqbs.csv\")\npennstate &lt;- iowascoringoff |&gt; filter(Opponent == \"Penn St.\")\nmich &lt;- iowascoringoff |&gt; filter(Opponent == \"Michigan\")\ntenn &lt;- iowascoringoff |&gt; filter(Opponent == \"Tennessee\")\n\nggplot() + geom_line(data = iowascoringoff, aes(x=Game, y=Points), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(data=pennstate, aes(x=5, y=2, label=Opponent)) +\n  geom_text(data=mich, aes(x=11.8, y=2, label=Opponent)) +\n  geom_text(data=tenn, aes(x=13.7, y=3.5, label=Opponent)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 27.56) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Points per game\", \n    x = \"Games\",\n    title = \"Iowa was bad at scoring points\",\n    subtitle = \"At 15.4 points/game, the Hawkeyes ranked dead last in the Power 5.\",\n    caption = \"Source: cfbstats.com | By Sam Pineda\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa only managed to score above the national average in points/game one time in 2023 in a 41-10 home win over Western Michigan. The Hawkeyes were also shut out three times, all three times at the hands of a ranked opponent. Iowa lost to those teams by a combined score of 92-0.\nWhen it comes to being shut out, Iowa has its fair share. Iowa has failed to score a point in 145 games in their history. Nebraska, in comparison, has been shut out only 98 times.\nThe quarterback play at Iowa has historically been somewhat average through the years. Recently, however, the quarterback position has been a dark smudge on an already ineffective offense. Head coach Kirk Ferentz, who had been criticized the year prior for his refusal to recruit players via the NCAA transfer portal, took two quarterbacks out of the transfer portal. Iowa welcomed Cade McNamara, a former starter for Michigan and who had defeated Iowa in the Big Ten Championship the prior season. In addition, Iowa also welcomed Deacon Hill, a backup for Wisconsin.\nWhen McNamara was suffered a season-ending injury early in the season, Hill was thrusted into the starting role and safe to say… it did not go particularly well.\n\n\nCode\niowaqbsmean &lt;- iowaqbs |&gt; filter(Cmp &gt; 3.27)\nraiola &lt;- iowaqbs |&gt; filter(Player==\"Dylan Raiola\")\nhill &lt;- iowaqbs |&gt; filter(Player==\"Deacon Hill\")\nmcnamara &lt;- iowaqbs |&gt; filter(Player==\"Cade McNamara\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = iowaqbsmean,\n    aes(x=Cmp, y=Yds),\n    color=\"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = raiola,\n    aes(x=Cmp, y=Yds),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = hill,\n    aes(x=Cmp, y=Yds),\n    color=\"gold\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = mcnamara,\n    aes(x=Cmp, y=Yds),\n    color=\"gold\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(data=raiola, aes(x=20.2, y=207, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(data=hill, aes(x=9.5, y=81, label=Player)) +\n  geom_text(data=mcnamara, aes(x=12, y=110, label=Player)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 250)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 25)) +\n  labs(\n    y = \"Average yards/game\", \n    x = \"Average completions/game\",\n    title = \"Both of Iowa's quarterbacks in 2023 didn't perform well\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite going 6-3 as a starter, Deacon Hill averaged under 100 passing yards/game.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows every Iowa quarterback in team history (any player that has completed a minimum three passes) and their average passing yards and completions over the course of their career as a Hawkeye. In McNamara’s defense, he was injured in just the fifth game of the year and would’ve been on his way to having among the top numbers of any Iowa quarterback in years past. Hill struggled with accuracy throughout his nine starts. He ended the season on a 49% completion rate, including only completing 10 passes on 28 attempts in the 12-10 loss to Minnesota (35.7%).\nAnother interesting note? Nebraska true freshman quarterback Dylan Raiola averaged more yards and completions in his first year than any Iowa quarterback has in their careers.\nSo, we’ve looked at how poor Iowa’s offense was. We still haven’t answered the question of how they managed to win 10 games, though. How did they do it?\nOne word: defense.\n\n\nCode\ndefscoring &lt;- read.csv(\"defscoring.csv\")\n\nggplot() + geom_line(data = defscoring, aes(x=Game, y=Points), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 25.93) +\n   labs(\n    y = \"Points per game\", \n    x = \"Games\",\n    title = \"Iowa's scoring defense was elite\",\n    subtitle = \"The Hawkeyes ranked fourth nationally in scoring defense and 16th in total defense.\",\n    caption = \"Source: cfbstats.com | By Sam Pineda\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa held their opponents to under 20 points in each of their ten wins, including a shutout win over Rutgers. Linebacker Jay Higgins also led the country in tackles in 2023 with 171 total tackles (71 solo). Kirk Ferentz’s teams are historically known for intercepting the ball on defense, and the 2023 team followed the trend being tied for ninth in the country for interceptions (16).\nIowa’s defense was elite in their ten wins, but what about their four losses?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gt)\n\niowawindefense &lt;- suppressWarnings (read.csv(\"iowawindefense.csv\"))\niowalossdefense &lt;- suppressWarnings (read.csv(\"iowalossdefense.csv\"))\n\nwindef &lt;- iowawindefense |&gt;\n  select(\n    Wins,\n    IowaRank,\n    YPG,\n    YPGAvg\n  )\n\nlossdef &lt;- iowalossdefense |&gt;\n  select(\n    Losses,\n    IowaRank,\n    YPG,\n    YPGAvg\n  )\n\nwindef |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    IowaRank = \"Iowa's rank\",\n    YPG = \"Yards per game\",\n    YPGAvg = \"YPG national average\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Iowa's defense when they win\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Sam Pineda | **Source:** cfbstats.com\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa's defense when they win\n\n\nWins\nIowa's rank\nYards per game\nYPG national average\n\n\n\n\n10\n22\n272.3\n323.7\n\n\n\nBy: Sam Pineda | Source: cfbstats.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlossdef |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    IowaRank = \"Iowa's rank\",\n    YPG = \"Yards per game\",\n    YPGAvg = \"YPG national average\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Iowa's defense when they lose\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Sam Pineda | **Source:** cfbstats.com\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 12)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa's defense when they lose\n\n\nLosses\nIowa's rank\nYards per game\nYPG national average\n\n\n\n\n4\n3\n308\n424.1\n\n\n\nBy: Sam Pineda | Source: cfbstats.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa’s total defense ranked in the top 25 nationally in games they both won and lost.

    "text": "Nebraska’s offense in 2023 was not good. How bad was it, really?\nIt’s no secret that Nebraska struggled to find good consistent play on offense. Combine that with injuries to key players on offense and a revolving door at the quarterback position, Nebraska failed to score at least 20 points in eight games. The Huskers also only averaged just over 300 yards/game (312).\nHow did Nebraska’s offense fair against the rest of the FBS?\nWell… to put it simply, not good.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#| message: false\nteamoff &lt;- read_csv(\"teamoffense.csv\")\n\n#| message: false\nnebraska &lt;- teamoff |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = teamoff,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraska,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 384.2421) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 27.56992) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=325, y=16, label=\"Nebraska\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average yards per game\", \n    y=\"Average points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's offense was among the worst in college football\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers ranked 123rd in scoring offense.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s first-year head coach Matt Rhule and offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield hand-picked former Georgia Tech quarterback Jeff Sims out of the transfer portal to lead the Huskers into the new era. It took only two disastorous games into the season for Rhule and company to look in a different direction.\nNebraska would start Heinrich Haarberg for the next eight games. While the Huskers went 5-3 in that span, the offense seemed to regress as the season went on and the turnovers piled on. Chubba Purdy would start the final two games, but it wasn’t enough to get Nebraska to the coveted sixth win.\nHow did all three Husker quarterbacks perform relative to the rest of the FBS quarterbacks?\n\n\nCode\npassing &lt;- read_csv(\"passing.csv\")\n\npassingavg &lt;- passing|&gt; filter(Att &gt; 97)\n\nnebraskaqb &lt;- passing |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = passingavg,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraskaqb,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 14.77976) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 6.803571) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1, y=6.5, label=\"Jeff Sims\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10, y=7.5, label=\"Heinrich Haarberg\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=3.5, label=\"Cubba Purdy\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Touchdowns\", \n    y=\"Total Interceptions\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's quarterbacks couldn't get it done through the air\", \n    subtitle=\"All three quarterbacks combined for 16 interceptions.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering the season, the Huskers had one of the more experienced running back rooms in the Big Ten. Anthony Grant returned for his senior season after a breakout year in 2022, while veterans Rahmir Johnson and Gabe Ervin Jr. were both back and healthy after a string of injuries.\nHowever, after Johnson and Ervin Jr. both suffered season-ending injuries early in the year, Anthony Grant and redshirt freshman Emmett Johnson were tasked with carrying the workload in the backfield for the remainder of the season. Heinrich Haarberg would also provide a consistent run threat, leading the team in rushing yards for the season.\nHow did Nebraska’s season rushing totals rack up against the Big Ten?\n\n\nCode\nteamrushing &lt;- read_csv(\"teamrushing.csv\")\n\nnebraskarb &lt;- teamrushing |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=teamrushing, aes(x=reorder(School, Yards), weight=Yards), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=nebraskarb, aes(x=reorder(School, Yards), weight=Yards), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Total rushing yards\", \n       ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = teamrushing, aes(reorder(School, Yards/G), weight = Yards/G), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nebraskarb, aes(x=reorder(School, Yards/G), weight=Yards/G), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Average yards/game\", \n       ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = teamrushing, aes(reorder(School, TD), weight = TD), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nebraskarb, aes(x=reorder(School, TD), weight=TD), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Total rushing touchdowns\", \n       ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar1 / bar2 / bar3 +\n  plot_layout(ncol = 2, nrow = 2, heights = c(10)) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Nebraska looked good on the ground\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers ranked among the top in total yards and yards per game.\",\n    caption = \"Source: cfbstats.com | By Sam Pineda\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the Huskers could run it… and run it pretty well. Why, then, are Nebraska’s team offense numbers so poor?\nAs good as they were running the ball at times, Nebraska had a very bad habit of putting the ball on the ground, too.\n\n\nCode\nfumbles &lt;- read_csv(\"fumbles.csv\")\n\nnebfumbles &lt;- fumbles |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = fumbles,\n    aes(x=Fumbles, y= FumblesLost),\n    color=\"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebfumbles,\n    aes(x=Fumbles, y= FumblesLost),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 15.43609) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 7.135338) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=29.5, y=14.3, label=\"Nebraska\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Fumbles\", \n    y=\"Fumbles lost\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's fumbling issues were disastrous\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's 31 fumbles were the most in a single season since San Jose State in 2017 (36).\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbstats.com | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for a team that has seen high fumbling numbers over the past ten seasons, 31 is an ugly outlier. What’s a statistic uglier than that? All three of Nebraska’s quarterbacks combined for 21 of those 31 fumbles, with Heinrich Haarberg putting the ball on the ground 13 times.\nWhen Nebraska wasn’t running the ball on offense, things were not so great. The Jeff Sims experiment was nothing short of a failure. While Heinrich Haarberg did well to go 5-3 as a starter, his inexperience as a college quarterback and propensity to turn the ball over massively contributed to the woes on offense.\nThe injury bug hit Lincoln hard in 2023. By the sixth game of the season, two of the top three running backs and wide receivers had suffered season-ending injuries. While that can’t be ignored as to why the offense struggled so much, the turnovers and quarterback ineptitude can’t be ignored, either."
