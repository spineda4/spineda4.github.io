    "text": "Nebraska’s offense in 2023 was not good. How bad was it, really?\nIt’s no secret that Nebraska struggled to find good consistent play on offense. Combine that with injuries to key players on offense and a revolving door at the quarterback position, Nebraska failed to score at least 20 points in eight games. The Huskers also only averaged just over 300 yards/game (312).\nHow did Nebraska’s offense fair against the rest of the FBS?\nWell… to put it simply, not good.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n#| message: false\nteamoff &lt;- read_csv(\"teamoffense.csv\")\n\n#| message: false\nnebraska &lt;- teamoff |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = teamoff,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraska,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 384.2421) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 27.56992) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=325, y=16, label=\"Nebraska\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average yards per game\", \n    y=\"Average points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's offense was among the worst in college football\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers ranked 123rd in scoring offense.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s first-year head coach Matt Rhule and offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield hand-picked former Georgia Tech quarterback Jeff Sims out of the transfer portal to lead the Huskers into the new era. It took only two disastorous games into the season for Rhule and company to look in a different direction.\nNebraska would start Heinrich Haarberg for the next eight games. While the Huskers went 5-3 in that span, the offense seemed to regress as the season went on and the turnovers piled on. Chubba Purdy would start the final two games, but it wasn’t enough to get Nebraska to the coveted sixth win.\nHow did all three Husker quarterbacks perform relative to the rest of the FBS quarterbacks?\n\n\nCode\npassing &lt;- read_csv(\"passing.csv\")\n\npassingavg &lt;- passing|&gt; filter(Att &gt; 97)\n\nnebraskaqb &lt;- passing |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = passingavg,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraskaqb,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 14.77976) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 6.803571) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1, y=6.5, label=\"Jeff Sims\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10, y=7.5, label=\"Heinrich Haarberg\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=3.5, label=\"Cubba Purdy\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Touchdowns\", \n    y=\"Total Interceptions\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's quarterbacks couldn't get it done through the air\", \n    subtitle=\"All three quarterbacks combined for 16 interceptions.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering the season, the Huskers had one of the more experienced running back rooms in the Big Ten. Anthony Grant returned for his senior season after a breakout year in 2022, while veterans Rahmir Johnson and Gabe Ervin Jr. were both back and healthy after a string of injuries.\nHowever, after Johnson and Ervin Jr. both suffered season-ending injuries early in the year, Anthony Grant and redshirt freshman Emmett Johnson were would carry the workload in the backfield for the year. Heinrich Haarberg would also provide a consistent run threat, leading the team in rushing yards for the season.\nHow did Nebraska’s season rushing totals rack up against the Big Ten?\n\n\nCode\nteamrushing &lt;- read_csv(\"teamrushing.csv\")\n\nnebraskarb &lt;- teamrushing |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=teamrushing, aes(x=reorder(School, Yards), weight=Yards), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=nebraskarb, aes(x=reorder(School, Yards), weight=Yards), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Total rushing yards\", \n       ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = teamrushing, aes(reorder(School, Yards/G), weight = Yards/G), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nebraskarb, aes(x=reorder(School, Yards/G), weight=Yards/G), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Average yards/game\", \n       ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = teamrushing, aes(reorder(School, TD), weight = TD), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = nebraskarb, aes(x=reorder(School, TD), weight=TD), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Total rushing touchdowns\", \n       ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar1 / bar2 / bar3 +\n  plot_layout(ncol = 2, nrow = 2, heights = c(10)) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Nebraska looked good on the ground\",\n    subtitle = \"The Huskers ranked among the top in total yards and yards per game.\",\n    caption = \"Source: cfbstats.com | By Sam Pineda\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the Huskers could run it… and run it pretty well. Why, then, are Nebraska’s team offense numbers so poor?\nAs good as they were on the ground, Nebraska had a very bad habit of putting the ball on the ground, too.\n\n\nCode\nfumbles &lt;- read_csv(\"fumbles.csv\")\n\nnebfumbles &lt;- fumbles |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = fumbles,\n    aes(x=Fumbles, y= FumblesLost),\n    color=\"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebfumbles,\n    aes(x=Fumbles, y= FumblesLost),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 15.43609) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 7.135338) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=29.5, y=14.3, label=\"Nebraska\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Fumbles\", \n    y=\"Fumbles lost\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's fumbling issues were disastrous\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's 31 fumbles were the most in a single season since San Jose State in 2017 (36).\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbstats.com | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for a team that has seen high fumbling numbers over the past ten seasons, 31 is an ugly outlier. What’s a statistic uglier than that? All three of Nebraska’s quarterbacks combined for 21 of those 31 fumbles, with Heinrich Haarberg putting the ball on the ground 13 times.\nWhen Nebraska wasn’t running the ball on offense, things were not so great. The Jeff Sims experiment was nothing short of a failure. While Heinrich Haarberg did well to go 5-3 as a starter, his inexperience as a college quarterback and propensity to turn the ball over massively contributed to the woes on offense.\nThe injury bug hit Lincoln hard in 2023. By the sixth game of the season, two of the top three running backs and wide receivers had suffered season-ending injuries. While that can’t be ignored as to why the offense struggled so much, the turnovers and quarterback ineptitude can’t be ignored, either."
