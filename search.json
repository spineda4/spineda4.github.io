    "text": "Nebraska’s offense in 2023 was not good. How bad was it, really?\nIt’s no secret that Nebraska struggled to find good consistent play on offense. Combine that with injuries to key players on offense and a revolving door at the quarterback position, Nebraska failed to score at least 20 points in eight games. The Huskers also only averaged just over 300 yards/game (312).\nHow did Nebraska’s offense fair against the rest of the FBS?\nWell… to put it simply, not good.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n#| message: false\nteamoff &lt;- read_csv(\"teamoffense.csv\")\n\n#| message: false\nnebraska &lt;- teamoff |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = teamoff,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraska,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 384.2421) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 27.56992) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=325, y=16, label=\"Nebraska\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average yards per game\", \n    y=\"Average points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's offense was among the worst in college football\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers ranked 123rd in scoring offense.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska’s first-year head coach Matt Rhule and offensive coordinator Marcus Satterfield hand-picked former Georgia Tech quarterback Jeff Sims out of the transfer portal to lead the Huskers into the new era. It took only two disastorous games into the season for Rhule and company to look in a different direction.\nNebraska would start Heinrich Haarberg for the next eight games. While the Huskers went 5-3 in that span, the offense seemed to regress as the season went on and the turnovers piled on. Chubba Purdy would start the final two games, but it wasn’t enough to get Nebraska to the coveted sixth win.\nHow did all three Husker quarterbacks perform relative to the rest of the FBS quarterbacks?\n\n\nCode\npassing &lt;- read_csv(\"passing.csv\")\n\npassingavg &lt;- passing|&gt; filter(Att &gt; 97)\n\nnebraskaqb &lt;- passing |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = passingavg,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraskaqb,\n    aes(x=TD, y=Int),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 14.77976) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 6.803571) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1, y=7.5, label=\"Jeff Sims\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10, y=8.5, label=\"Heinrich Haarberg\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=7, y=4, label=\"Cubba Purdy\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total Touchdowns\", \n    y=\"Total Interceptions\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's quarterbacks couldn't get it done through the air\", \n    subtitle=\"All three quarterbacks combined for 16 interceptions.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
