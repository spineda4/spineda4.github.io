    "text": "Nebraska’s offense in 2023 was not good. How bad was it, really?\nIt’s no secret that Nebraska struggled to find good consistent play on offense. Combine that with injuries to key players on offense and a revolving door at the quarterback position, Nebraska failed to score at least 20 points in eight games. The Huskers also only averaged just over 300 yards/game (312).\nHow did Nebraska’s offense fair against the rest of the FBS?\nWell… to put it simply, not good.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n#| message: false\nteamoff &lt;- read_csv(\"teamoffense.csv\")\n\n#| message: false\nnebraska &lt;- teamoff |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = teamoff,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"black\",\n    alpha=.4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = nebraska,\n    aes(x=TotalYds, y=Pts),\n    color=\"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 384.2421) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 27.56992) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=325, y=16, label=\"Nebraska\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Average yards per game\", \n    y=\"Average points per game\", \n    title=\"Nebraska's offense was among the worst in college football\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers ranked 123rd in scoring offense.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Sam Pineda\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 11), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )"
